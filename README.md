**RedBus Project â€“ Web Scraping**  

The **RedBus Web Scraping Project** involves extracting real-time bus booking data, schedules, prices, seat availability, and route details from the RedBus website. The goal is to collect and analyze travel trends, pricing variations, and demand patterns for better decision-making in the transportation sector.  

**Project Workflow:**  
1. **Web Scraping Implementation:**  
   - Using Python libraries like **Selenium** to extract data from RedBus.  
   - Automating browser interactions to fetch dynamic content such as ticket prices, seat availability, and operator details.  

2. **Data Processing & Storage:**  
   - Cleaning and structuring the extracted data in **Pandas DataFrame**.  
   - Storing data in **CSV, Excel, or a database (SQL/MongoDB)** for further analysis.  

3. **Data Analysis & Visualization:**  
   - Identifying pricing trends based on routes, seasons, and demand fluctuations.  
   - Visualizing data using **Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Power BI** for better insights.  

4. **Applications & Use Cases:**  
   - Competitive analysis for bus operators.  
   - Predictive analytics for pricing strategies.  
   - Enhancing user experience through travel insights.
